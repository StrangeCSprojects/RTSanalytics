    """
    Initializes a DataRetriever object to abstract the interaction with a database.
    This design allows for flexibility in working with different types of databases
    by not hard-coding the class to a specific database implementation. The class
    serves as an interface between the database and other parts of the program,
    facilitating data retrieval without requiring direct database manipulation.

        Constructor for the DataRetriever class.

        Parameters:
        - database: An object or configuration representing the database connection.
                    This can be an instance of a database connection class, a configuration
                    dictionary, or any other format required by the specific database
                    implementation being used. It allows the DataRetriever to interact
